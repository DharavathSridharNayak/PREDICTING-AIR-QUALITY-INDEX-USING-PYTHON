ðŸ’¨ PREDICTING-AIR-QUALITY-INDEX-USING-PYTHON

The "Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) Using Python" project is a data science and machine learning initiative aimed at forecasting air pollution levels based on historical environmental data. The AQI is a crucial metric that indicates how clean or polluted the air is, along with potential health risks. This project leverages Pythonâ€™s data analysis and machine learning libraries to preprocess, analyze, and predict AQI values, helping in environmental monitoring and public health awareness.

Key Components of the Project:


Data Collection & Preprocessing

Gathering air quality data (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, SOâ‚‚, NOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ levels).

Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):



Visualizing trends, correlations, and pollution patterns using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

Machine Learning Models for Prediction

Training regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict AQI.

Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.

Real-time AQI Forecasting (Optional)

Integrating APIs (e.g., OpenAQ, government datasets) for live data prediction.
